    <h1>The Importance of <em>Exercise</em></h1>

    <p>
      In today's sedentary lifestyle, exercise has become more important than
      ever. With increasing reliance on technology and desk-bound jobs, physical
      activity is often neglected, leading to a host of health issues.
      <s>It's time to break this cycle.</s>
    </p>

    <h2>Benefits of Regular <u>Exercise</u></h2>

    <p>
      Regular <em>exercise</em> offers numerous benefits for both physical and
      mental well-being:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Improved Physical Health:</strong> <em>Exercise</em> helps
        maintain a healthy weight, reduces the risk of chronic diseases such as
        heart disease and diabetes, and strengthens muscles and bones.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Enhanced Mental Health:</strong> Physical activity releases
        endorphins, which are chemicals in the brain that help improve mood and
        reduce stress and anxiety. <sup>[1]</sup>

      <li>
        <strong>Increased Energy Levels:</strong> Regular
        <em>exercise</em> boosts energy levels and reduces feelings of fatigue,

        <strong>Better Sleep:</strong> <em>Exercise</em> promotes better sleep
        quality, helping individuals fall asleep faster and enjoy deeper, more
        restorative sleep.
